/**
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>body</b> Required for text messages.
 *     <p>The text of the text message which can contain URLs which begin with http:// or https:// and formatting. See available formatting options here.
 * If you include URLs in your text and want to include a preview box in text messages (preview_url: true), make sure the URL starts with http:// or https:// â€”https:// URLs are preferred. You must include a hostname, since IP addresses will not be matched.
 * <b>Maximum length: 4096 characters</b></p>
 *     </li>
 *     <li><b>preview_url</b> optional
 *     <p>
 *         By default, WhatsApp recognizes URLs and makes them clickable, but you can also include a preview box with more information about the link. Set this field to true if you want to include a URL preview box.
 * The majority of the time, the receiver will see a URL they can click on when you send an URL, set preview_url to true, and provide a body object with a http or https link.
 * URL previews are only rendered after one of the following has happened:
 * The business has sent a message template to the user.
 * The user initiates a conversation with a "click to chat" link.
 * The user adds the business phone number to their address book and initiates a conversation.
 * Default: false.
 * </li>
 *     </p>
